{"title":"The $60,000 Patch: A Newcomer's One-Week Triumph","created_at":1737423082000,"updated_at":1737533371089,"content":"\nIn mid-October, after three rounds of assessments and interviews, I finally get a work from a company that specializing in open-source IoT and embedded development.\n\nAs an application engineer at this company, my responsibilities include building libraries, maintaining product documentation on the wiki, and creating customized demos for various edge computing devices. Just a few days into the role, I learned about a legacy issue with one of the products. Specifically, the RS485 interfaces had a critical flaw that prevented the port from properly switching the data direction.\n\nThe R&D team had previously attempted to address this issue at the application layer by developing a utility tool called `rs485_DE` using C. This tool would open the original RS485 port (e.g., `/dev/ttyAMA2`), then create a new virtual serial port, and monitor data on the virtual port. It would then automatically toggle the chip's $\\overline{\\text{RE}}$ pin based on the data flow direction. However, this approach introduced a new issue: the higher baud rates, the more frequently data loss would occurr. The root cause was the tool's reliance on polling to check the buffers, coupled with the use of the `libgpiod` library to manipulate GPIOs for flow control, which was too slow to meet the performance requirements.\n\nAdding to the complexity, the RS485 transceiver chip used in the product was the TPT7487. On this chip, the $\\overline{\\text{RE}}$ pin is responsible for controlling the chip's mode - either receive or transmit. However, instead of being connected to dedicated DTR pins, the $\\overline{\\text{RE}}$ pin was wired to several general-purpose GPIO pins on the Compute Module 4 (CM4). Unfortunately, the kernel driver did not configure these GPIOs as DTR pins, further limiting the ability to implement a hardware-based solution for automatic data direction control.\n\n![The general-purpose GPIO pins to RS485 transceiver chips](https://assets.n0w0n.com/the_60000_usd_patch_is_a_triumph/1.png)\n![The RS485 transceiver schematic](https://assets.n0w0n.com/the_60000_usd_patch_is_a_triumph/2.png)\n\nAfter thorough discussions and evaluations, the team concluded that replacing all affected products was the only viable solution. Despite the significant cost - an estimated $60,000 - the company prioritized customer satisfaction and product reliability. With no better technical solution available, the recall decision was made to uphold the company's reputation and ensure long-term trust from customers.\n\nOut of curiosity, I requested the schematic of the product and, after some analysis, I surprisingly discovered what I believed could be a potential software solution to the issues. That marked the beginning of a new chapter in addressing the problem.\n\n\n\n## A Kernel-Level Approach to the Issue\n\nFrom the above schematic and the [TPT7487 datasheet](http://file.3peakic.com.cn:8080/product/Datasheet_TPT7487-TPT7488.pdf), it became clear that when the CM4_RS485_n_DTR (where n = [1, 2, 3]) pins are low, the transceiver enters receive mode; when they are high, the chip switches to transmit mode.\n\nSince this product is based on the CM4, it is highly likely that most users would download and install the official Raspberry Pi OS image, which meant that modifying and redistributing the Raspberry Pi Linux kernel driver would be impractical. This approach would introduce significant inconvenience for users - especially since we don't even have an independent apt source!\n\nNow the problem was clear: a solution that required kernel changes or custom distribution wouldn't work in this environment.\n\nAs I continued to think about the issue, I realized that I could write an out-of-tree kernel module to control the $\\overline{\\text{RE}}$ pin and thus achieve automatic toggling of the transceiver mode. However, the challenge was to implement this solution without relying on polling, which had been a major flaw in the original approach. At the time, I didn't have much experience with kernel modules, but I decided to take a chance and try to solve it.\n\nI recalled an idea I had seen previously in server monitoring tools, where file changes could be tracked by hooking into the syscall layer. Inspired by this concept, I figured I could apply the same principle to monitor the UART calls and control the $\\overline{\\text{RE}}$ pin's state. Instead of polling, I thought I could hook into the relevant functions that handle data transmission and reception, allowing me to change the pin's state dynamically in response to the data flow direction.\n\nBy leveraging this approach, I aimed to develop a solution that was both efficient and non-intrusive, providing a clean software-level fix without needing to modify the underlying kernel or disrupt the user experience.\n\n## The Challenges with Kernel Modifications\n\nAs I began exploring potential solutions to hook syscalls, I encountered a significant challenge with the existing syscall hook implementations. Many of the examples I found were designed for kernel versions prior to 5.7. This limitation stemmed from the fact that, starting from kernel 5.7, the `kallsyms_lookup_name` function was no longer exported, which meant the approach of directly searching for kernel symbols by name wouldn't work.\n\nAfter researching alternatives, I discovered that the kprobe mechanism could be used to achieve the same goal. The kprobe is a powerful tool in the Linux kernel that allows for dynamic instrumentation of functions at runtime. By using kprobe, I could locate and interact with kernel symbols (such as syscalls) even on newer kernels where `kallsyms_lookup_name` is not available. This discovery provided a way to work around the limitations of newer kernel versions.\n\nWith this in mind, I proceeded to write a kernel module to implement syscall hooking using kprobe. The following code demonstrates how to hook the `mkdir` syscall, replacing it with a custom version. The module dynamically locates kernel symbols using kprobe, bypassing the restriction imposed by kernel 5.7 and above.\n\nBTW, The following code is designed to work with ARM64 architecture. For x86_64 architecture, [the full demo has been provided on GitHub](https://github.com/bclswl0827/linux-syscall-hook-mkdir/tree/master).\n\n```cpp\n#include <asm/unistd.h>\n#include <linux/kallsyms.h>\n#include <linux/kernel.h>\n#include <linux/kprobes.h>\n#include <linux/module.h>\n#include <linux/version.h>\n#include <linux/vmalloc.h>\n\n#define MODULE_NAME \"syscall_hook\"\n#define LOG_PREFIX MODULE_NAME \": \"\n\nMODULE_DESCRIPTION(\"A simple module that hooks the `mkdir` function, works on kernel 5.7 and higher.\");\nMODULE_AUTHOR(\"Joshua Lee <chengxun.li@seeed.cc>\");\nMODULE_LICENSE(\"Dual MIT/GPL\");\nMODULE_VERSION(\"0.0.1\");\n\n// For Linux 5.7 and higher versions, `kallsyms_lookup_name` is not exported anymore.\n// But we can use `kprobe` to find the address of `kallsyms_lookup_name`.\n// The `custom_kallsyms_lookup_name` represents the address of `kallsyms_lookup_name` internally.\n// For kernel 5.7 and below, the `custom_kallsyms_lookup_name` simply calls to `kallsyms_lookup_name`.\n#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(5, 7, 0)\ntypedef unsigned long (*kallsyms_lookup_name_t)(const char* name);\nstatic kallsyms_lookup_name_t custom_kallsyms_lookup_name;\n#else\n#define custom_kallsyms_lookup_name kallsyms_lookup_name\n#endif\n\n// `fixup_kallsyms_lookup_name` extracts the address of `kallsyms_lookup_name` from `kprobe`.\n// It returns 0 on success, -EFAULT on failure.\nstatic int fixup_kallsyms_lookup_name(void) {\n#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(5, 7, 0)\n    struct kprobe kp = {.symbol_name = \"kallsyms_lookup_name\"};\n    int result = register_kprobe(&kp);\n    if (result < 0) {\n        printk(KERN_ERR LOG_PREFIX \"Failed to register kprobe, returned code: %d\\n\", result);\n        return result;\n    }\n    custom_kallsyms_lookup_name = (kallsyms_lookup_name_t)kp.addr;\n    unregister_kprobe(&kp);\n    if (!custom_kallsyms_lookup_name) {\n        printk(KERN_ERR LOG_PREFIX \"Failed to get address for `kallsyms_lookup_name`\\n\");\n        return -EFAULT;\n    }\n    printk(KERN_DEBUG LOG_PREFIX \"Got address for `kallsyms_lookup_name`: %p\\n\", custom_kallsyms_lookup_name);\n    return 0;\n#else\n    return 0;\n#endif\n}\n\nstruct vm_struct* (*custom_find_vm_area)(const void* base_addr);

There was no need to replace products or recall shipments, saving the company $60,000 and sparing customers from potential inconvenience. Well, the software-level solution proved efficient, effective, and sustainable.\n\nThis experience reaffirmed the importance of thinking creatively when addressing challenges. Even as a newcomer, I was able to leverage open-source tools and innovative thinking to tackle a seemingly insurmountable problem. It’s a reminder that in technology, persistence and curiosity often yield unexpected and rewarding outcomes.\n","words":23012}
