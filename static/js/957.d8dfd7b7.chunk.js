But this approach may not perform well because it's not that fast as you may thought - at least it was vividly reflected in one of my recent needs.\n\nRecently I took over a maker-level project that uses the Raspberry Pi and in the project, the Pi needs to continuously poll the level of a certain output from the FPGA at high speed to determine whether the data is \"ready\". However, as the price of Raspberry Pi rises, I had to consider the affordable alternative, finally I settled on the Orange Pi One, which uses the Allwinner H3 and has a 512 MB of RAM - That's enough for my needs.\n\nIn the original Raspberry Pi implementation for the project, the state of the GPIO pins was obtained directly by accessing the GPIO registers - the memory mapping (mmap), and we know that different SOCs have different internal register sets and addresses, so to port the project to the Allwinner H3, some significant changes in the code were required.\n\nThis article will introduce how I understand the concept of mmap, and how did I analyse the datasheet provided by Allwinner, in the last, I'll provide a complete example of how to use mmap to access GPIO pins in C, Go, and Python.\n\n![Orange Pi One](https://assets.n0w0n.com/allwinner_h3_memory_mapping/1.jpg)\n\n",words:22791}].reduce(((e,t)=>{const a=new Date(t.created_at).getFullYear();return e[a]||(e[a]=[]),e[a].push(t),e}),{}),t=Object.keys(e).sort(((e,t)=>Number(t)-Number(e)));return(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"max-w-3xl mx-auto px-10 space-y-8 animate-fade-right",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-3xl font-extrabold text-gray-800 mb-6 text-center",children:"Post Archive"}),t.map((t=>(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"mb-8",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-2xl text-gray-700 font-semibold mb-4 border-b pb-2 border-gray-300",children:t}),(0,n.jsx)("ul",{className:"space-y-4",children:e[Number(t)].map((e=>(0,n.jsx)("li",{className:"",children:(0,n.jsx)(s.N_,{to:"/post/".concat(e.slug),className:"text-lg text-gray-600 hover:text-amber-600 transition-all",children:e.title})},e.slug)))})]},t)))]})}}}]);
