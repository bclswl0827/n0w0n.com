I'm currently working as an Application Engineer at [Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com) in Shenzhen. I also had work experience as an embedded developer at a commercial aerospace company in Beijing.\n\nThis blog was created to share my practice and experience, you can get the source code of this blog [here](https://github.com/bclswl0827/n0w0n.com) (Built with TypeScript, React and Tailwind). Previously I host my blog on `ibcl.us`, but the old one was closed due to the pressure of Ministry of State Security of China, beacuse one of the posts *hurt* them lol, **now this domain no longer belongs to me and it was bought by someone else for scam, so please be aware**.\n\nI usually like to play around with Linux and STM32/Arduino and some gadgets. BTW, I've been interested in seismology recently and have written some Go libraries libraries that fill a gap in this area.\n\nFinally, I hope this blog can bring you some joy and you can find something useful here.\n\n![My GitHub Illustrations](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=bclswl0827&show_icons=true&bg_color=ffffff&border_color=d0d7de&hide_title=true&disable_animations=true&include_all_commits=true&count_private=true&role=OWNER,COLLABORATOR,ORGANIZATION_MEMBER)\n\n*In order to prevent me from being invited to have coffee with them again, any traffic from China has been blocked now.*\n"})})]})}}]);
